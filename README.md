This News App is powered by the GNews public API and provides users with the latest news articles from around the world. The app offers a user-friendly interface where news articles are organized by categories, allowing users to easily browse and read articles of their interest. 

## Features

- **Category-based News**: The app categorizes news articles into various categories, including entertainment, business, sports, technology, health, science, and more. Users can click on a category to view articles specific to that category.

- **Search News**: The app includes a search bar that enables users to search for specific news articles. Users can enter keywords related to the news they are interested in, and the app will display relevant articles based on the search query.

- **Article Details**: Each article is displayed with a title, description, publication date, channel, and a link to visit the source website. This ensures that users can get a comprehensive understanding of the news article before deciding to read more.

- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience across different screen sizes and devices. Whether users access the app from their desktop, tablet, or smartphone, the interface will adapt smoothly to fit their device.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a robust foundation for creating interactive and dynamic components.

- **Redux**: Redux is used for state management in the app. It helps manage the global state of the application and enables a more organized and predictable way of handling data flows.

- **Styled-Components**: Styled-Components is used for styling the app. It allows developers to write CSS within JavaScript, making it easier to manage styles for individual components.

- **React-Bootstrap**: React-Bootstrap is utilized for building responsive and customizable UI components. It provides a wide range of pre-built components that can be easily integrated into the app.
